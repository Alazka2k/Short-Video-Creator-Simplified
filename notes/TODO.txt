# Improvements:

- Improve and parametrize the initial Prompt
    - Tone of the narrator
    - Vibe
    - Perspective
    - Realistic / Fantastic
    - Language Option

LLM Generation Improvements:
    - Enrich the output json / output structure for image generation to seperate all parameters and store them independently in the database
    - Output for Description is always the same (with three ...)
    - Image Pattern can not be empty (e.g. Emtpy String for "shotStyle":"",) is not working as expected - LLM still outputs something

Voice Generation Improvements:
    - New endpoint for batch generation for every scene in one llm output
    - Enrich the API request for generate to have 1. a object for voiceData

Image Generation Improvements:
    - New endpoint for batch generation for every scene in one llm output
    - Enrich the API request for generate to have 1. a object for imageData, where we seperate and define the additional parameters of the prompt (after integration of the database)

Animation Generation Improvements:
    - Animation Pattern Generator needs to check the length of the audio
    - The metadata.json should store the originalPattern and the finalPattern (currently only originalPattern)
    - The generated pattern adds padding zeros what makes the animation look unnatural. We need to add a check if the length of the animation pattern is equal to the voice animation.
      If the pattern is to short, we need to send it to the LLM with the request to prolong it to the needed length.

Music Generation Improvements
    - The music needs to be cutted in the length of the total of all video before the complete video is created.
      Or alternatively we need to find a way to shorten the music in the request before creation.
