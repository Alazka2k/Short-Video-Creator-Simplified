Attention: Please construct the new content visual prompts exactly in the same way as in the given example after the semicolon. The structure has to be consistent for follow up services.
E.g. for the values:     
    "artistStyle":"by Jakub Rozalski.",
    "shotStyle":"Photorealistic, cinematic",
    "aspectRatioPrompt":"--ar",
    "aspectRatio":"9:16",
    "stylePrompt":"--style",
    "style":"raw",
    "sPrompt":"--s",
    "sValue":"500",

    "version":"6.1",
    the second part of visual_prompt must look like:
; by Jakub Rozalski. Photorealistic, cinematic --ar 9:16 --style raw --s 500 --v 6.1
